# Let’s Begin!

**Today’s tools for managing work are broken**

You love your team and your teammates.

You want to do your best work, and help everyone do their best work, too.

You’ve probably tried a few work tracking tools (i.e. task managers, issue trackers, etc.) over the years.

And if you’re anything like us, you’ve probably discovered how broken they are:

## → Task managers erode morale

Task managers are heavy, bloated, slow, and just plain discouraging to use. The most important task is the one that just got added, the context switching is endless, the backlog grows infinitely, and forward momentum feels fleeting. Teams feel entrapped, not empowered.

## → Task managers aren’t designed for how modern teams work

Task managers have steep learning curves, in part because they’re designed for productivity wonks — the kinds of folks comfortable thinking in complex, algorithm-like [GTD flows](http://www.alchemists-ark.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Getting_Things_Done_Flowchart-e1505805230415.png).

These tools rely heavily on their users learning complicated task management methodologies — or inventing their own. And then there’s the inevitable disagreement in how to use them, and the fallout from ongoing human error.

## → Proportionally few members of the team use a task manager

For all of the above reasons (and so many more), this class of tools tends to be adopted by only a fraction of a given organization — like engineering or sales. Invariably, our teammates in design, accounting, comms, admin, marketing, and so many other disciplines, are largely left behind, or asked to get onboard with an industrial-grade technical issue tracker.

Hold up. Aren’t our tools are supposed to make us more powerful?

Aren’t they supposed to work for us, and not the other way around?

Naturally we started to wonder:

- What if you could work with tasks the same way you already communicate with your team: in plain language?
- What if the endless list melted away, and you always knew what needed your focus?
- What if everyone had ambient visibility into what the team was working on, and when things got done?
- What if you could make tasks with (and for) teammates without having to stop your conversation with them?
- What if someone made a tasking tool that just got out of your way?

So we got to work. And here we are today.

Say hello to [Begin](https://begin.com/)!
