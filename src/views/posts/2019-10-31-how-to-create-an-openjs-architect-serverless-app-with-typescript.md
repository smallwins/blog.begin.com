In this article we’ll set up an Architect project that uses TypeScript to compile code for AWS Lambda.

Let’s get started! First, let’s create a new Architect project:

```bash
npm init @architect ./myTSapp
```

The init script generates a new, single Lambda function in `src/http/get-index/index.js` which we’ll overwrite with code generated by the TypeScript compiler.

For now, define a new entry file at `src/http/get-index/index.ts`

```js
// src/http/get-index/index.ts

export async function handler(req: object) {
  return {
    body: JSON.stringify({ok: true})
  }
}
```

> Notice: we’re using TypeScript syntax!

## Install TypeScript

TypeScript is extremely configurable and can be extended for many use cases with relative ease. First install it:

```bash
npm i typescript
```

## Configure TypeScript

The final boss (already)! We need to configure TypeScript to transpile `entry.ts` into `index.js`. This way both local dev and live deployment will work as we’d expect them to. Create `tsconf.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "files": [
    "./src/http/get-index/index.ts"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
```
[View source](https://github.com/brianleroux/arc-example-typescript/blob/master/tsconfig.json)

We won’t dig into the config too much, but you’re certainly welcome to! Suffice to say, this will generate a CommonJS module that AWS Lambda can run.

## Configure npm scripts

Add the classic `npm start` and `npm run build` commands:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "npx tsc",
    "start": "npm run build && npx arc sandbox",
    "deploy": "npm run build && npx arc deploy"
  },
```

Work locally, then deploy to AWS when you’re happy with your app

## Set up CI/CD

Now that everything is working locally we can set up Begin to deploy our code from GitHub whenever we commit. Login to Begin with your GitHub account, click New app, and scroll to the big Import app button. (My first build was completed in 11.003 seconds!)

You can use the GitHub repo [brianleroux/arc-example-typescript](https://github.com/brianleroux/arc-example-typescript) to get started.

## That’s it!

Now you’re up and running with serverless TypeScript.

`async function handler (req: object) {}` returns the above!
