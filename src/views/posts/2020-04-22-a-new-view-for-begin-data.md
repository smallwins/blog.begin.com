## [Begin Data](https://docs.begin.com/en/data/begin-data) is a fast, durable key value store that comes with every Begin app — even the free ones!

Begin Data is **minimal, distributed, low-latency, SSD-based, and is open source and built on [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)**, which makes it perfect for many use cases Beginners have asked us for.

## The new view

We heard that you wanted to be able to access your Begin Data from the Begin console, which is why today we’re making that a little easier by adding a new view specifically for Begin Data.

Head to your app, **click Data in the left nav**, and from there you can see and better manage your persistent storage:
