## We‘re excited to announce that Begin apps will deploy with any default branch you configure in GitHub.

Beginners can now change their default branch to any name (and even associate new apps with existing repos that use a default branch of any name), and it will automatically be picked up and used by Begin.

This feature is a nice improvement for customization and a small step forward in promoting the use of inclusive language and terminology within our industry.

For example, you can now rename `master` branch to `main` and Begin will continue deploying to `staging` and `production` environments on every `git push`. At Begin, we are proud to enable open workflows while maintaining best practices.
